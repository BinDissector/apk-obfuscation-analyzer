# APK Obfuscation Analyzer Dependencies

# No Python dependencies required for basic functionality
# The tool relies on jadx (external tool) for APK decompilation

# Optional: For enhanced analysis features
# Uncomment the packages you want to use:

# androguard>=3.4.0  # Resource obfuscation analysis (resources.arsc parsing) - RECOMMENDED
# matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For generating charts (optional)
# pandas>=1.5.0      # For data analysis (optional)

# To enable resource analysis:
#   pip install androguard
# This adds analysis of Android resource files (resource names, string resources, etc.)

# Note: jadx must be installed separately
# Installation instructions: https://github.com/skylot/jadx
